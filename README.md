ambition to compare CARRA and ERA5 for an interesting climate event over Greenland complex terrain, a rainfall / high temperature event in say June 2022 https://twitter.com/Vejrkonsulenten/status/1538659120856936451?s=20&t=mKKsMtepkVbk0ZzcXrGIZg, currently as late as CARRA data are available and an interesting event is observed

aim to reproject and resample the ERA5 data to the CARRA grid and perhaps plot a difference animation, alongside the CARRA results (precip and temperature). The complex terrain aspect with rain/snow would drive home the value of CARRA in a climate-change-extreme context. 

?monthly anomaly map, since September appears to be record-setting and CARRA data begin 1991, giving a real climate baseline

The codebase could be later re-applied to say the 23-26 September, 2022 Fiona rain event which had the strongest/latest melting for Greenland on record; need to demonstrate how the extreme was record-setting, e.g. using GC-Net record since 1997 at South Dome, Greenland.

That content could be useful in the Copernicus EU state of the climate report.
